## Advent of code day 2

# Objective : Compute the number of safe report(s) in the report list given as input of the problem
# A report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:
# - The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
# - Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.
